#Introduction
The purpose of this homework assignment is to explore, analyze and model a dataset containing 8161 observations and 26 variables. The dataset are records representing a customer at an auto insurance company.

Each record has two response variables. The first response variable, TARGET_FLAG which is binary (0,1). If someone was in car crash the value is 1 and if the person was not in a car cash the value is 0. 

The second response variable is TARGET_ATM. If someone was in a car cash the value is 1 and if they did not crash their car the value is greater than 0.

#Objective and Requirements
The objective is to build multiple linear regression and binary logistic regression models on the training data to predict the probability that a person will crash their car and also the amount of money it will cost if the person does crash their car. 

Ony the variables that are given or variables derived from the variables provided. 

#Approach
The team met to discuss this assignment and an approach to plan to complete the assignment. Each of the 5 team members was assigned tasks. The following tasks were assigned:

*Data Exploration
*Data Preparation
*Build Models
*Select Models

Github was used to manage the project. Using Github helped with version control and ensured each team member had access to the latest version of the project documentation. 
Slack was used to by the team to communicate during the project and for quick access to code and documentation.

#Dataset
For reproducibility of the results, the data was loaded to and accessed from a Github repository. 
```{r Read data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
insurance <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/621-Group2/HW4/master/insurance_training_data.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")

#Remove the index from tehd dataset
insurance$INDEX <- NULL

head(insurance)
```
#Data Exploration

##Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statisitics was performed for all predictor and response variables to explore the data. 
```{r descriptive statistics, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Calculate mean missing values per variable
insurance %>% summarize_all(funs(sum(is.na(.)) / length(.)))

#Use Describe Package to calculate Descriptive Statistic
(InsuranceTrain_des <- describe(insurance, na.rm=TRUE, interp=FALSE, skew=TRUE, ranges=TRUE, trim=.1, type=3, check=TRUE, fast=FALSE, quant=c(.1,.25,.75,.90), IQR=TRUE))
```

##Correlation Analysis
There is high correlation amoung several predictors CLM_FREQ and MVR_PTS; KIDSDRV and AGE; GET_FLAT and TARGET_AMT; AGE and HOMEKIDS. 
```{r correlation, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggcorr(insurance)

```
#Analysis of predictors
Each predictor was examed to determine whether transformation is needed.
